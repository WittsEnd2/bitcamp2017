# Bitell

## Synopsis

This is an Android attempting to pair people who have ideas to people who don't have an idea but want to build something. It uses a like
and dislike system so that the algorithm can determine which projects to a particular user. 

## Stack
 
The app uses primarily Android Java and XML for the front-end/back-end and uses Firebase as the database. Particularly, it uses Firebase authentication and real-time database.

## Motivation

One of the biggest issues at a hackathon or any hacking group is that people struggle developing ideas. We hope to reduce the struggle and save time by giving hackers an opportunity to find a project they want to work on.
